# Changelog

* Added featured image support on homepage

#### Version 1.0.0

* Added support for PrismJS
* Added Google+ Comments

# How to use

### PrismJS

Use 3 backticks to start your syntax highlighting and close it with 3 backticks.

To define the highlighting simple attach, "language-whicheverlanguage"

Example:

* language-bash
* language-php
* language-css
* language-html
* language-lolcode

### Google+ Comments

Well, there really isn't much for you to configure with this one - it's pretty much ready to go out of the box.

### Featured Image

In addition to syntax highlighting - this is something I feel is sorely missing from the default Casper. The images are set to fit the content 100% so this should not be an issue.


# Why do this?

Simple, Ghost is absolutely phenomenal, although, there are a few issues I've got - the complete lack of a native comment system is one, the other syntax highlighting and thirdly no featured image on home page support. So you end up with this modified version of the Casper theme which is going to be a work-in-progress for quite some time.
