# Casper Modified

A slightly modified version of the default theme for Ghost (Casper)

# What's different?

* Added PrismJS for syntax highlighting
* Added Google+ Comments

# How to use

### PrismJS

Use 3 backticks to start your syntax highlighting and close it with 3 backticks.

To define the highlighting simple attach, "language-whicheverlanguage"

Example:

* language-bash
* language-php
* language-css
* language-html
* language-lolcode

### Google+ Comments

Well, there really isn't much for you to configure with this one - it's pretty much ready to go out of the box.
